                <h2>$FLASH Token — Disclosures & Notices</h2>
                
                <h3>Nature of $FLASH</h3>
                <p>$FLASH is a cryptoasset that reflects the tokenization of the FlashScreener community and brand around the tool/extension. It does not grant equity, dividends, governance, voting, or any rights equivalent to shares/quotas of the tool or of any operating entity. <strong>$FLASH is not a guaranteed investment</strong>, nor should it be interpreted as, an offer of securities.</p>

                <h3>No financial or legal advice</h3>
                <p>Any information about $FLASH provided on the website, extension, or official channels is informational/educational only and does not constitute financial, legal, tax, or investment advice. Acquiring, trading, or using $FLASH is solely the user's responsibility.</p>

                <h3>Volatility and risks</h3>
                <p class="highlight-text">Cryptoassets are highly volatile. Don't spend money you are not willing or able to lose.</p>
                <p>Users should assess their risk tolerance and seek independent professional advice if needed.</p>

                <h3>Extension remains free and independent of the token</h3>
                <p>The FlashScreener extension remains <strong>free and open to all users</strong>. No purchase or holding of $FLASH is required to install, access, or use the extension, now or in the future.</p>

                <h3>No affiliation or endorsement by Google</h3>
                <p>The extension may run in the Google Chrome browser, but $FLASH is not affiliated with, sponsored, endorsed, or associated with Google LLC or Google Chrome. "Google" and "Chrome" are trademarks of their respective owners. Any reference is descriptive only.</p>

                <h3>Data, privacy, and $FLASH</h3>
                <p>Interactions with $FLASH occur via third-party wallets (e.g., Phantom, Solflare) and external platforms (e.g., DEXs, Pump.fun). <strong>We do not collect seed phrases or private keys and will never ask for them.</strong></p>
                <p>Public addresses, balances, transactions, and other on-chain data are public by design on the Solana blockchain. We may read, display, or aggregate such data (e.g., holder counts, developer buybacks, liquidity status) for transparency, analytics, or informational purposes.</p>

                <h3>Third-party platforms</h3>
                <p>Buying, selling, swapping, providing liquidity, or any other $FLASH operations (when available) occur on third-party platforms. We do not control listings, pairs, prices, fees, liquidity locks, or uptime of those platforms. Links or embeds (e.g., charts) are provided for convenience and do not constitute endorsement.</p>

                <h3>Updates to this section</h3>
                <p>We may update these token-related disclosures at any time to reflect legal, technical, or operational changes. The current version will always be published on this page.</p>

                <h3>APIs & third-party services</h3>
                <p>This bot currently queries the following public API: <strong>GeckoTerminal (by CoinGecko)</strong> — prices, pairs, market cap.</p>
                <p>By using the bot, you acknowledge that your use of data from this service is subject to the provider's terms and privacy policies. We are not affiliated with or endorsed by CoinGecko/GeckoTerminal, Solana Foundation, or Telegram. All trademarks are the property of their respective owners.</p>

                <h3>Permissions</h3>
                <p>The bot does not require admin privileges. In groups, it only works if it can read messages. It does not send unsolicited private messages.</p>
