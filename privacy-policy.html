                <h3>Nature of $FLASH</h3>
                <p>$FLASH is a cryptoasset that reflects the tokenization of the FlashScreener community and brand around the tool/extension. It does not grant equity, dividends, governance, voting, or any rights equivalent to shares/quotas of the tool or of any operating entity. <strong>$FLASH is not a guaranteed investment</strong>, nor should it be interpreted as, an offer of securities.</p>

                <h3>No financial or legal advice</h3>
                <p>Any information about $FLASH provided on the website, extension, or official channels is informational/educational only and does not constitute financial, legal, tax, or investment advice. Acquiring, trading, or using $FLASH is solely the user's responsibility.</p>

                <h3>Volatility and risks</h3>
                <p class="highlight-text">Cryptoassets are highly volatile. Don't spend money you are not willing or able to lose.</p>
                <p>Users should assess their risk tolerance and seek independent professional advice if needed.</p>

                <h3>Extension remains free and independent of the token</h3>
