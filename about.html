    <p>
      This page is dedicated to tell the story of how it all began and how the construction of FlashScreener progressed.
    </p>

    <h3>GENESIS</h3>
    <p>
      It all started in 2024, with peak activity in the trenches. Mfers in their underwear made more money 
      from a laptop in their bedrooms than judges and doctors working the entire month. Dozens, hundreds, thousands of CAs 
      on the timeline per day. Anyone would go crazy with the numbers.
    </p>

    <h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
    <p>
      It turns out that this, while profitable in many cases, proved to be somewhat tedious at certain points. And this is 
      a big problem when we're talking about an environment where seconds make a difference. Having to open and check dozens 
      of CAs per day and analyze the vital points of each one is a tedious task. And I myself couldn't take it anymore. 
      Someone would send me the CA of a token on Twitter/X, and I'd have to copy, paste into a new tab, and redo the process 
      on a new website because the one I was on before didn't have the information I wanted. In short, annoying.
    </p>

    <h3>THE IDEA</h3>
    <p>
      Then I had an idea. What if there was a tool that wasn't necessarily automatic and analyzed everything for me, but at 
      least cut out the hassle of having to open the sites for each CA? So I sent a message in the pump.fun support group on 
      Telegram, which was full of degens at that time. And then I asked if there was a tool that could do this kind of thing. The 
      people there didn't quite understand what I meant, and I couldn't quite express what I was envisioning; the idea was too 
      fresh, and I couldn't organize myself to explain it to others.
    </p>

    <h3>WHAT IF?</h3>
    <p>
      What if I made this tool myself? I saw the possibilities, if it was feasible to develop such a thing. I had this idea in my 
      head for weeks until I took the first steps. At that time, it was just a personal tool, which I was making for myself, maybe a few
      friends who wanted to use it, but the extension was something especially made for me to fix the boredom of opening thousand CAs.
    </p>

    <h3>IMPLEMENTATION</h3>
    <p>
      I wrote the first draft of the code to simply open CAs on PumpFun. At the time, the temporary title I gave this tool was 
      "check.fun," since it was a tool that, in a sense, checked CAs. I sometimes called it shortcutfun. It was the prototypes that 
      would become the final version, FlashScreener. Although I had the idea much earlier, I decided to take action by the first weeks
      of 2025. On January 23 I posted the first update on X. On January 26, I submitted the project and paid the submission fee to Google.
      That was the beginning of something big.
    </p>

    <h3>EVOLUTION</h3>
    <p>
      As time went by, some close friends and I always used the extension. In fact, the feature to open CA in Photon was a specific 
      request from a friend. Talking to these friends, they always showed me a lot of enthusiasm and praised how it helped them 
      and that they couldn't live without the extension in their daily trenching anymore. This got me thinking: I'm a big fan of my tool; my
      friends really enjoy it. Would more people like to enjoy this experience too? That's when I decided to tokenize the project.
    </p>

    <h3>TOKENIZATION</h3>
    <p>
      Many people have asked me: Why tokenize a product that's free and anyone can use? Why would anyone buy the coin? My answer is quite 
      simple. Currently, what drives trenches and motivates the masses to buy tokens, whether memes or utility tokens, is the possibility 
      of making a profit and being part of something great. This doesn't mean that $FLASH is an investment with promised profits; on the 
      contrary, it's a token like any other memecoin; the community and culture are what make the project successful. A super-hyped 
      meme without community and leadership is nothing more than an empty and artificial pump; and a token with unique utility and cutting-edge 
      leadership, but without community and culture, is nothing more than a flop. So why not combine the best of both and see what happens? $FLASH
      is where the degenerate and unemployed world of trenches meets the utility and tek of a serious project. Free and open to everyone, 
      where everybody has the same chances and opportunities, and I will do my best to take our community to the highest levels ever seen by a 
      token created on pump fun. Because this isn't just about FlashScreener, this is about our culture.
