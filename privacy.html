  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <h2>How FlashScreener handles and protects your data</h2>

  <!-- Content -->
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how the <strong>FlashScreener</strong> Chrome Extension ("we", "our", "the Extension") handles user data.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Information Collection</h3>
    <p>
      The Extension does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personally identifiable information (PII).
      All operations occur locally within the user’s browser. We do not use external servers or databases to process or store data.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Permissions</h3>
    <p>
      The Extension may request certain Chrome permissions (such as context menus, storage, or activeTab) in order to provide its core functionality.
      These permissions are used exclusively for the features described in the Extension’s description and are not used to access personal or sensitive data.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Data Sharing</h3>
    <p>
      We do not share, sell, or transfer user data to third parties under any circumstances.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Extension Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>
      The Extension does not use third-party analytics, advertising networks, or tracking tools.
    </p>

    <h3>5. User Control</h3>
    <p>
      Since no personal data is collected, there is no data for the user to request access to, modify, or delete.
      The user can uninstall the Extension at any time through their browser settings.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Updates</h3>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any updates will be published at this URL with a new effective date.

    <h3 id="token-policy">8. $FLASH Token — Disclosures &amp; Notices</h3>

    <p><strong>Nature of $FLASH</strong><br>
      $FLASH is a cryptoasset that reflects the tokenization of the FlashScreener community and brand around the tool/extension.
      It does not grant equity, dividends, governance, voting, or any rights equivalent to shares/quotas of the tool or of any operating entity.
      $FLASH is not a guaranteed investment, nor should it be interpreted as, an offer of securities.
    </p>

    <p><strong>No financial or legal advice</strong><br>
      Any information about $FLASH provided on the website, extension, or official channels is informational/educational only and does not constitute financial, legal, tax, or investment advice.
      Acquiring, trading, or using $FLASH is solely the user’s responsibility.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Volatility and risks</strong><br>
      Cryptoassets are highly volatile. Don't spend money you are not willing or able to lose.
      Users should assess their risk tolerance and seek independent professional advice if needed.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Extension remains free and independent of the token</strong><br>
      The FlashScreener extension remains free and open to all users. No purchase or holding of $FLASH is required to install, access, or use the extension, now or in the future.
    </p>

    <p><strong>No affiliation or endorsement by Google</strong><br>
      The extension may run in the Google Chrome browser, but $FLASH is not affiliated with, sponsored, endorsed, or associated with Google LLC or Google Chrome.
      “Google” and “Chrome” are trademarks of their respective owners. Any reference is descriptive only.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Data, privacy, and $FLASH</strong><br>
      Interactions with $FLASH occur via third-party wallets (e.g., Phantom, Solflare) and external platforms (e.g., DEXs, Pump.fun). We do not collect seed phrases or private keys and will never ask for them.
      Public addresses, balances, transactions, and other on-chain data are public by design on the Solana blockchain. We may read, display, or aggregate such data (e.g., holder counts, developer buybacks, liquidity status) for transparency, analytics, or informational purposes.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Third-party platforms</strong><br>
      Buying, selling, swapping, providing liquidity, or any other $FLASH operations (when available) occur on third-party platforms. We do not control listings, pairs, prices, fees, liquidity locks, or uptime of those platforms.
      Links or embeds (e.g., charts) are provided for convenience and do not constitute endorsement.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Eligibility and compliance</strong><br>
      You are responsible for ensuring that accessing, holding, or trading $FLASH is permitted under the laws applicable to you.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Updates to this section</strong><br>
      We may update these token-related disclosures at any time to reflect legal, technical, or operational changes. The current version will always be published on this page.
